If you use the looper_demo_example.py code, please credit this GitHub repo!!!

## to use claude_api_test.py:

You will need an Anthropic developer account & API credits to use the Claude API:
https://console.anthropic.com

You will also need Python. I highly recommend doing all this in a conda environment. Follow the installation instructions for Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/anaconda/install

For a clean, basic example of the Claude API in Python:

1) Clone this repository by clicking on the green button at the top of the repo, and downloading and extracting the .zip folder to wherever you want it on your system, eg. your Documents folder.

2) In the Terminal (Mac & Linux) or Command Line (Windows), navigate to the file directory on your system where you've cloned this repo, eg. /home/user/Documents/repos/tech_tea_and_exchange_residency.

```bash
cd YOUR_FILE_PATH_HERE
```

(Note that if you are using Windows, the slashes in your file path should face this way: \)

3) run claude_api_test.py

```bash
python claude_api_test.py
```

(Note that you need to be connected to the internet to use the API.
